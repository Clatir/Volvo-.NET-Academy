    [_Exit_, R.H.]

  _King._ (C.) I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.

    [_Exit_ HORATIO, R.H.]

  Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son,

    [_Exit_ QUEEN, _attended_, R.H.]

  Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;[46]

    [_To_ LAERTES.]

  We'll put the matter to the present push.--
  This grave shall have a living monument:[47]
  An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
  Till then, in patience our proceeding be.

    [_The characters group round the grave._]


SCENE II.--HALL IN THE CASTLE.

    _Enter_ HAMLET _and_ HORATIO (R.H.)

  _Ham._ But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
  That to Laertes I forgot myself;
  For by the image of my cause,[48] I see
  The portraiture of his.

  _Hor._                 Peace! who comes here?

    _Enter_ OSRIC (L.H.)

  _Osr._ Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.

_Ham._ (C.) I humbly thank you, sir.--Dost know this water-fly?[49]

_Hor._ (R.) No, my good lord.

_Ham._ Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him.

_Osr._ (L.) Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart a thing to you from his majesty.

_Ham._ I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit.[50] Your
bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.

_Osr._ I thank your lordship, 'tis very hot.

_Ham._ No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.

_Osr._ It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

_Ham._ But yet, methinks it is very sultry and hot,[51] for my
complexion,--

_Osr._ Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere,--I cannot
tell how.--But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you, that he
has laid a great wager on your head: Sir, this is the matter,--

_Ham._ I beseech you, remember----

  [HAMLET _moves him to put on his hat._]

_Osr._ Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.[52] Sir, here
is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman,
full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great
showing:[53] Indeed, to speak feelingly of him,[54] he is the card or
calendar of gentry,[55] for you shall find in him the continent of
what part a gentleman would see.[56]

_Ham._ What imports the nomination of this gentleman?[57]

_Osr._ Of Laertes?

_Ham._ Of him, sir.

_Osr._ Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--

_Ham._ I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself.[58]

_Osr._ I mean, sir, for his weapon.

_Ham._ What is his weapon?

_Osr._ Rapier and dagger.

_Ham._ That's two of his weapons: but, well.

_Osr._ The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses:
against the which he has imponed,[59] as I take it, six French
rapiers and poignards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,[60] or
so: Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal
conceit.[61]

_Ham._ What call you the carriages?

_Osr._ The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

_Ham._ The phrase would be more german[62] to the matter, if we could
carry cannon by our sides.

_Osr._ The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between
yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; and it would
come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the
answer.[63]

_Ham._ How if I answer no?[64]

_Osr._ I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.

_Ham._ Sir, it is the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be
brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will
win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and
the odd hits.

_Osr._ Shall I deliver you so?

_Ham._ To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.

_Osr._ I commend my duty to your lordship. [_Exit_, L.H.]

_Hor._ (R.) You will lose this wager, my lord.

_Ham._ (C.) I do not think so; since he went into France, I have been
in continual practice; I shall win at the odds.[65] But thou wouldst
not think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.

_Hor._ Nay, good my lord.

_Ham._ It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving,[66]
as would, perhaps, trouble a woman.

_Hor._ If your mind dislike any thing, obey it:[67] I will forestall
their repair hither, and say, you are not fit.

_Ham._ Not a whit, we defy augury: there is a special providence in
the fall of a sparrow.

  [_Exeunt_, L.H.]

    considered irascible and timid.]

    [Footnote I.104: _Eternal blazon_] _i.e._, publication or

    [Footnote I.118:

      _There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark--
      But he's an arrant knave._]

    Hamlet probably begins these words in the ardour of confidence
    and sincerity; but suddenly alarmed at the magnitude of the
    disclosure he was going to make, and considering that, not his
    friend Horatio only, but another person was present, he breaks
    off suddenly:--"There's ne'er a villain in all Denmark that can
    match (perhaps he would have said) my uncle in villainy; but
    recollecting the danger of such a declaration, he pauses for a
    moment, and then abruptly concludes:--"but he's an arrant
    knave."]

    [Footnote I.125: _Friending to you--shall not lack_] Disposition
    to serve you shall not be wanting.]

    estimate of himself.]

    History of Edward VI., says "Katharine Parre, Queen Dowager to
    King Henry VIII., was a woman _beautified_ with many excellent
    virtues." The same expression is frequently used by other old
    authors.]

    [Footnote II.13: _In her excellent white bosom_,] The ladies, in
    Shakespeare's time, wore pockets in the front of their stays.]

    book._]

    [Footnote II.25: _I'll board him presently._] Accost, address
    him.]

    [Footnote II.26: _You are a fishmonger._] This was an expression
    better understood in Shakespeare's time than at present, and no
    doubt was relished by the audience of the Globe Theatre as
    applicable to the Papists, who in Queen Elizabeth's time were
    esteemed enemies to the Government. (Length: 3095 characters)
- Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;[24]
  And he, repuls'd (a short tale to make),
  Fell into sadness; thence into a weakness;
  Thence to a lightness; and, by this declension,
  Into the madness wherein now he raves,
  And all we mourn for.

  _King._              Do you think 'tis this?

  _Queen._ It may be, very likely.

  _Pol._ Hath there been such a time (I'd fain know that,)
  That I have positively said, _'tis so_,
  When it proved otherwise?

  _King._                  Not that I know.

  _Pol._ Take this from this, if it be otherwise:

    [_Pointing to his head and shoulder._]

  If circumstances lead me, I will find
  Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
  Within the centre.

  _King._           How may we try it further?

  _Pol._ You know, sometimes he walks for hours together
  Here in the lobby.

  _Queen._          So he does, indeed.

  _Pol._ At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
  Mark the encounter: if he love her not,
  And be not from his reason fallen thereon,
  Let me be no assistant for a state,
  But keep a farm, and carters.

  _King._                      We will try it.

  _Queen._ But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.

  _Pol._ Away, I do beseech you both, away:
  I'll board him presently.[25]

    [_Exeunt_ KING _and_ QUEEN, R.H.]

    _Enter_ HAMLET, _reading_ (L.C.)

_Pol._ How does my good lord Hamlet?

_Ham._ (C.) Excellent well.

_Pol._ (R.) Do you know me, my lord?

_Ham._ Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.[26]

_Pol._ Not I, my lord.

_Ham._ Then I would you were so honest a man.

_Pol._ Honest, my lord!

_Ham._ Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
picked out of ten thousand.

_Pol._ That's very true, my lord.

_Ham._ For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god,
kissing carrion,----Have you a daughter?[27]

_Pol._ I have, my lord.

_Ham._ Let her not walk i'the sun: conception is a blessing; but as
your daughter may conceive,--friend, look to't, look to't, look to't.

  [_Goes up stage._]

_Pol._ (_Aside._) Still harping on my daughter:--yet he knew me not
at first; he said I was a fishmonger.

[_Crosses to_ L.]

I'll speak to him again.--What do you read, my lord?

_Ham._ (C.) Words, words, words.

_Pol._ (L.) What is the matter, my lord?

_Ham._ Between who?

_Pol._ I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.

_Ham._ Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue[28] says here that old
men have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful
lack of wit, together with most weak hams: All of which, sir, though
I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to
have it thus set down; for yourself, sir, shall be as old as I am,
if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  [_Crosses_, L.]

_Pol._ (_Aside._) Though this be madness, yet there's method in it. (Length: 3011 characters)
- Ophelia wishes
    to remind the Queen of the sorrow and contrition she ought to
    feel for her unlawful marriage; and that she may wear her rue
    with peculiar propriety on Sundays, when she solicits pardon for
    the crime which she has so much occasion to _rue_ and repent
    of.--MALONE.]

    [Footnote IV.28: _You may wear your rue with a difference._]
    _i.e._, to distinguish it from that worn by Ophelia, herself:

    Queen ought to flow for her guilt.]

    to young women, not to trust the fair promises of their lovers.]

    bones_,] Not only the sword, but the helmet, gauntlet, spurs, and

    anciently depicted, from whence the term _coat_ of armour), are
    hung over the grave of every knight.]

  They say the owl was a baker's daughter.[13] We know
  what we are, but know not what we may be.

  _King._ Conceit upon her father.[14]

  _Oph._ Pray, you, let us have no words of this; but when
  they ask you what it means, say you this:

    _To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day_,
      _All in the morning betime_,
    _And I, a maid at your window_,
