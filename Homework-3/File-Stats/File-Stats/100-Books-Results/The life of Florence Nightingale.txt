- I believe it is this singular
capacity of observation and of understanding what observed appearances
imply which gives him his singular influence over lunatics.”

In a concluding chapter, Miss Nightingale refers to the dangers of
“reckless physicking by amateur females,” and tells of the lady who,
having procured a prescription for a blue pill which suited her during
one indisposition, proceeded to dose not only herself but her family
too, “for all complaints upon all occasions.” Then there are the women
who have no ideas beyond calomel and aperients, and the Lady Bountifuls
who dose their poorer neighbours with a favourite prescription when it
would be doing more good if they persuaded the people to “remove the
dung-hill from before the door, to put in a window which opens, or an
Arnott’s ventilator, or to cleanse and lime-wash their cottages.”

She has some last words to say on nursing as a profession, and gives
a humorous little thrust at “the commonly received idea among men,
and even among women themselves, that it requires nothing but a
disappointment in love, the want of an object, a general disgust,
or incapacity for other things, to turn a woman into a good nurse.”
“This reminds one of the parish where a stupid old man was set to be
school-master because he was ‘past keeping the pigs.’”

Miss Nightingale sums up the matter with some condensed wisdom on the
question as to whether women are fitted for the medical and other
professions. (Length: 1491 characters)
- Of course she was willing to help everybody,
but it stood to reason she could not receive them all; why, the park
wouldn’t have held the folks that came, and besides, the old squire
wouldn’t have his daughter made a staring stock of.”

London shared the disappointment of Derbyshire in not being
permitted to give Florence Nightingale a public welcome, but the
situation was realised by the genial Mr. _Punch_ in the sympathetic
lines quoted at the heading of this chapter.

_Punch_ had had his joke when the “dear Nightingales” first went to the
succour of the soldiers, but the day for raillery was past; a great
humanitarian work had been accomplished, which the genial humorist was
quick to acknowledge on the return of the heroine in a cartoon showing
“Mr. _Punch’s_ design for a statue to Miss Nightingale.” It represented
her in nurse’s dress, wearing the badge “Scutari” across her breast,
and holding a wounded soldier by the hand. (Length: 1102 characters)
- I never thought to see the poor dog greet me
again.”

“Yes, doesn’t he look better?” said the youthful nurse with pardonable
pride. “You can throw away that rope now, and help me to make
compresses.”

“That I will, missy,” said Roger, and stooping down beside Florence and
Cap, he was initiated into the mysteries.

“Yes,” said the vicar, “Miss Florence is quite right, Roger--your dog
will soon be able to walk again if you give it a little rest and care.”

“I am sure I can’t thank your reverence and the young lady enough,”
replied the shepherd, quite overcome at the sight of his faithful dog’s
look of content and the thought that he would not lose him after all;
“and you may be sure, sir, I will carry out the instructions.”

“But I shall come again to-morrow, Roger,” interposed Florence, who had
no idea of giving up her patient yet. “I know mamma will let me when I
tell her about poor Cap.” After a parting caress to the dog, and many
last injunctions to Roger, Florence mounted her pony and rode away with
the vicar, her young heart very full of joy. (Length: 1084 characters)

- Y.,’ said the lady who sent for the doctor, ‘and what did
you do?’

“‘Well, you know, miss, I studied a bit, and then I mixed all three
together, because then, you know, I was sure I got the right one.’

“The consequences to the poor woman may be imagined!

“Another poor woman, in a different county, took something which had
been sent to her husband for a bad leg, believing herself to have
fever. ‘Well, miss,’ she said, ‘it did me a sight of good, and look at
me, baint I quite peart?’ The ‘peartness’ ended in fever.”

The manners of the women to their children in many cases are greatly
in need of reform, and Miss Nightingale quotes the injunction of an
affectionate mother to her child about going to school, “I’ll bang your
brains out if you don’t do it _voluntally_.”

Miss Nightingale deals in her paper with the need for drastic measures
to promote rural sanitation such as drainage, proper water supply,
scavenging, removal of dust and manure heaps from close proximity to
the houses, and the inspection of dairies and cowsheds. (Length: 1062 characters)
