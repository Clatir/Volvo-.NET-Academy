Top 10 Longest Sentences:
- Moses, also, the son of Amram, the leader of God’s people, the man who
was filled with the grace and abundance of the Holy Spirit—’twas he that
wrote this holy narrative[859] beyond in the genesis of the law, in
order that the friendly counsel which the Lord Himself gave to Abraham
in imposing[860] pilgrimage upon him might abide always with the church,
when He said, EXI DE TERRA, ‘Leave thy country and thy land for my
sake.’

HAEC QUIDEM HISTORIA[861] NOTA EST, ABRAHAM A DOMINO PRECEPTUM FUISSE UT
TERRAM CALDEORUM DESERERET ET TERRAM REPROMISSIONIS[862] ADIRET. ‘It is
a famous story in the Scriptures, the Lord Himself imposing it on
Abraham to leave the land of the Chaldees, which was his rightful
patrimony, and go in pilgrimage to the Land of Promise, because of the
benefits that would arise therefrom to himself, and to his children, and
to their race after them.’

ISTE AUTEM ABRAHAM CAPUT FIDEI EST, ET PATER OMNIUM FIDELIUM, SICUT
DICIT APOSTOLUS. ‘The man, moreover, to whom God gave this counsel,
viz., Abraham, he it is that is reckoned in the Scriptures as father of
all the faithful, as the Apostle certifies when he says OMNES QUI SUNT
EX FIDE, HII SUNT FILII ABRAHÆ: “they are truly the sons of Abraham,”
says the Apostle, “all those who imitate the perfect faith.”’

QUOD AUTEM PATRI FIDELIUM PRECIPITUR,[863] HOC OMNIBUS FILIIS EJUS
IMPLENDUM RELINQUITUR, UT TERRAM SUAM DESERANT ET CARNALEM PATRIAM
DERELINQUANT. ‘The good [counsel],[864] then, that God enjoined here on
the father of the faithful, viz., on Abraham, is also required to be
observed by his sons after him, viz., by all the faithful, to wit, that
they should abandon their country and land, their wealth and worldly
delight, for the Lord of the elements, and go in perfect pilgrimage
after his example.’

TRES AUTEM SUNT MODI VOCATIONUM. ‘In three ways, moreover, the
people[865] are called to the knowledge and friendship of the Lord.’

PRIMUS EX DEO. ‘The first way is, firstly, the inciting[866] and
inflaming of the people by the divine grace, that they may come to serve
the Lord, after the example of Paul and the monk Anthony, and of the
other faithful monks who served God yonder in Egypt.’

SECUNDUS PER HOMINEM. ‘The people are called, then, in the second way
through man, viz. through the holy preceptors who preach in the divine
Scriptures to the people, after the example of the Apostle Paul, who
preached to Gentiles, until he brought them by the net of the Gospel to
the harbour of life.’

TERTIUS EX NECESSITATE. ‘The people are called, then, in the third way,
through necessity, viz., when they are forced to serve God through
tribulations and perils of death, or through parting with their temporal
goods,[867] according to the example of the people of Israel, who
frequently turned to the Lord from the worship of idols and images when
forced to do so by the troubles and hardships they suffered[868] from
the stranger tribes, as is related in the Holy Scriptures.’ HINC DAVID
DICIT. ‘And it is to illustrate this the prophet David says,
“CLAMAVERUNT AD DOMINUM CUM TRIBULAR[U]NTUR, ET DE NECESSITATIBUS EORUM
LIBERAVIT EOS.”’ ‘When the people of Israel would experience[869] great
tribulations and hardships, they used to implore and beseech the Lord
until He used to free them from those hardships.’

ABRAHAM IGITUR DIVINA GRATIA INSTINCTUS MANDATUM QUOD FUERAT EI
IMPERATUM A DOMINO IMPLEVIT,[870] ET EXIIT[871] IN HARAN,[872] IN QUA
MORTUUS EST PATER EJUS, ET INDE TRANSMIGRAVIT IN TERRAM
REPROMISSIONIS.[873] ‘Abraham, then, the head of perfect devotion, and
of the perfect faith, when prompted by the divine grace, fulfilled the
commandment imposed on him by the Lord—viz., he went into the land of
the Chaldees [to Haran,[874] where his father died; and went from
thence] to the Land of Promise.’

TRIBUS AUTEM MODIS PATRIA DESERITUR, UNO INUTILI ET DUOBUS UTILIBUS.
‘There are also three modes by which one leaves his patrimony when he
goes as a pilgrim; and there is one of them for which no reward is
obtained from God, and [there are] two for which it is obtained.’

ALIQUANDO ENIM PATRIA CORPORE TAMEN RELINQUITUR, NEC MENS A CARNALIBUS
STUDIIS ALIENATUR, NEC BONA OPERA APPETUNTUR. ‘That is because[875]
sometimes one leaves his patrimony in the body only, and his mind
abstains[876] not from sins and vices, and he yearns not to do acts of
virtue or good works.’

IN TALI IGITUR PEREGRINATIONE NIL NISI AFFLICTIO CORPORIS SIT, NULLUS
VERO ANIME PROFECTUS. ‘From the pilgrimage that is performed so,
moreover, neither fruit nor profit[877] arises to the soul, but vain
labour and motion of body; for it is little profit to one to abandon his
fatherland, unless he does good away from it.’[878]

NAM ET POSTQUAM ABRAHAM CORPORE PATRIA EXIVIT,[879] TUNC EI[880] DOMINUS
DIXIT. ‘For even Abraham himself, it was after he had left his own
country, and after separating from it according to the body, that the
Lord gave him this counsel, when He said, “EXI DE TERRA TUA,” “Withdraw
thy mind henceforth from thy country and from thy land, and let not thy
intention be towards returning to it again.”’

AC SI APERTE DICERET, CARNALIA VITIA PATRIÆ IN QUA FUERAS CORPORE, MENTE
SIMUL ET CORPORE DEVITA. ‘As if it was what God Himself would openly say
to Abraham, “Avoid in body and mind from henceforth, in thy pilgrimage,
the sins and vices of the country in which thou didst formerly abide
according to the body;” for it is the same to one as if he would
abide[881] in his fatherland, if he followed the customs of his
fatherland in his pilgrimage.’

NON ENIM IN VIA PEDUM SED IN VIA MORUM PROXIMATUR AD DOMINUM. ‘For it is
not by way of foot, nor by motion of body, that one draws nigh unto God,
but through the exercise[882] of good customs and virtues.’

ALIQUANDO MENTE TAMEN PATRIA RELINQUITUR ET NON CORPORE SICUT SUNT
QUIDAM QUI QUAMVIS IN PATRIA PERAGUNT VITAM REGIONE, PATRIAM TAMEN
VIVENDO CARNALITER NON NORUNT, SED JUSTIS CAUSIS QUIBUSDAM COGENTIBUS IN
SUIS LOCIS MANENT HABITANTES QUASI NON HABITANTES. ‘Another time,
however, one leaves his fatherland from zeal of heart and mind, although
he leaves it not in body, as happens to the dignitaries who spend their
lives in their own countries until death, because laics and clerics[883]
detain them in the lands in which they may be, on account of the extent
of their usefulness to all; and because that it is not through[884]
carnality they remain in their fatherland, their good-will[885]
comprehends pilgrimage for them with the Lord.’

ALIQUANDO MENTE ET CORPORE, UT SUNT HII QUIBUS DICITUR. ‘Sometimes,
moreover, one leaves his country altogether in body and mind, as the
Apostles and the people of the perfect pilgrimage left it, to whom the
Lord promised great benefits in the Gospel, when He said, “VOS QUI
DERELIQUISTIS OMNIA PROPTER ME, PATREM ET MATREM, UXOREM FILIOS ET
FILIAS, AGRUM ET OMNIA QUAE HABERE POTUISTIS, CENTUPLUM ACCIPIETIS IN
HOC SAECULO, ET VITAM ETERNAM IN FUTURO.” “Make sure of this,” said
Jesus, “little or much[886] as you have abandoned for my sake your
country and kindred, your possessions and worldly pleasures, that you
shall receive a hundred times the equivalent of good from me here in
this world, and in the perpetual life beyond after the judgment of
doom.”’

HII SUNT VERI PEREGRINI[887] QUI CUM PSALMISTA POSSUNT DICERE. ‘These
are truly the people of the perfect pilgrimage in whose persons the
prophet said, in proclaiming and giving thanks to God, “ADVENA SUM APUD
TE, DOMINE, ET PEREGRINUS SICUT OMNES PATRES MEI,” “I give thee thanks
for it, O God,” says the prophet, “that I am in pilgrimage and exile in
the world, after the example of the seniors[888] who have gone before.”’

Multitudes of the faithful servants of the Lord, moreover, both of the
Old and New Testament, have perfectly observed this profitable counsel,
viz., left their country and land, their patrimony and kindred, for the
sake of the Lord of the elements, and went in voluntary pilgrimage to
far distant countries, in the same way as he observed it, and abandoned
his natural inheritance for the love and fear of the Lord—the eminent
saint and eminent sage, and the elect son of God, for whom there is a
festival and commemoration at the occurrence[889] of this season and
time, _i.e._ SANCTUS PRESBYTER[890] Columba, viz., the illustrious
priest of Inis-Gaidel,[891] the battle-brand who was endowed with the
talents and various gifts of the Holy Ghost, to wit, the person[892]
Saint Colum Cille, son of Fedlimidh [son[893] of Fergus Cennfoda, son of
Conall Gulban, son of Niall Naoighiallach]. (Length: 8744 characters)

- Those who prefer the religious who live in communities
in cities before the anchorites, say that they have more worth because
they meet with more opposition; whereas those who live in solitude being
quiet and not subject to temptations, have not so much virtue; to which
Nilus replies that there are as many temptations in solitude as in
cities, and that the reason why some persons argue so is because they
regard outward sins only, not considering that there are infinite
temptations and spiritual sins which encounter us as well in privacy as
in cities; and he therefore supports the opinion that the solitary life
is the higher form of the religious life.[440] Isidore of Seville, too,
in the seventh century, distinguishes between the different kinds of
monks, and says that the Cœnobites are they that live in common, like
those in the days of the apostles, who sold their goods and had all
things in common; the Hermits, they that withdraw into desert places and
vast solitudes in imitation of Elias and John the Baptist, delighting,
with a wonderful contempt of the world, in total solitude; and the
Anchorites, they who, having perfected themselves in cœnobitical life,
shut themselves up in cells apart from the aspect of men, inaccessible
to all, and living in the sole contemplation of God.[441] But Bede, who
was a Benedictine monk, seems also to regard the life of an anchorite as
a higher form of religious life, when in his History he says of Cudberct
on his retiring to the island of Farne, that, ‘advancing in the merits
of his devout intention, he proceeded even to the adoption of a hermit
life of solitary contemplation and secret silence;’ and, in his Life,
that ‘he was now permitted to ascend to the leisure of divine
speculation, and rejoiced that he had now reached the lot of those of
whom we sing in the Psalm, The saints shall go from virtue to virtue;
the God of Gods shall be seen in Sion.’[442]

The preference for this mode of life, as the highest form of a religious
life that could be attained, seems to have arisen from an overstrained
interpretation of some passages of Scripture. (Length: 2148 characters)
- It bears the title _Columcille fecit_, and
has been thus translated:—

          Delightful would it be to me to be in _Uchd Ailiun_
            On the pinnacle of a rock,
          That I might often see
            The face of the ocean;
          That I might see its heaving waves
            Over the wide ocean,
          When they chant music to their Father
            Upon the world’s course;
          That I might see its level sparkling strand,
            It would be no cause of sorrow;
          That I might hear the song of the wonderful birds,
            Source of happiness;
          That I might hear the thunder of the crowding waves
            Upon the rocks;
          That I might hear the roar by the side of the church
            Of the surrounding sea;
          That I might see its noble flocks
            Over the watery ocean;
          That I might see the sea monsters,
            The greatest of all wonders;
          That I might see its ebb and flood
            In their career;
          That my mystical name might be, I say,
             _Cul ri Erin_ (Back turned to Ireland);
          That contrition might come upon my heart
            Upon looking at her;
          That I might bewail my evils all,
            Though it were difficult to compute them;
          That I might bless the Lord
            Who conserves all,
          Heaven with its countless bright orders,
            Land, strand, and flood;
          That I might search the books all,
            That would be good for any soul;
          At times kneeling to beloved heaven;
            At times at psalm-singing;
          At times contemplating the King of Heaven,
            Holy the chief;
          At times at work without compulsion;
            This would be delightful. (Length: 1848 characters)
- Thus
it is told of Mochaoi, abbot of Nendrum, that on one occasion he went
with seven score young men to cut wattles to make the _ecclais_, or
church.[114] When Ciaran of Saighir, who was one of the twelve apostles
of Ireland, proceeded to erect his huts and church, he is said to have
constructed them of the rudest materials, and when he went into the wood
for these a wild boar assisted him by biting off with his sharp teeth
the rods and branches for the purpose.[115] Coemgen of Glendalough, too,
built his oratory of rods of wood, planks, and moss;[116] and in
Conchubran’s Life of Monenna we are told that ‘she founded a monastery,
which was made of smooth planks, according to the fashion of the
Scottish nations, who were not accustomed to erect stone walls or get
them erected.’[117] The church in these early monasteries was thus, as
well as the huts or bothies for the accommodation of the monks,
frequently built of wood; and the usual name given to this early wooden
church was _Duirthech_, or _Deirthech_, of which the Latin equivalent
was ‘oratorium.’ Of this word various etymologies are given; but the
most probable is that contained in an old glossary which tells us that
_Duirtheach_ comes from _Dairthech_, a house of oak, and _Deirthech_
from _Dear_, a tear, that is, a house in which tears are shed.[118]

It was not till the end of the eighth century, when the ravages of the
Danes and their repeated destruction of the churches by fire showed the
great insecurity of these wooden buildings, that they began, when
reconstructed, to be built of stone, and the _cloicteach_, or stone
belfry, was then added to the ecclesiastical buildings. (Length: 1686 characters)
- There is
nothing impossible in a small boat being driven before an east wind as
far as Culross; and certain it is that on the shore where she is said to
have landed there was a small chapel dedicated to Kentigern.[364] We
learn from the narrative that there had been an earlier church at
Glasgow founded by Ninian, which Kentigern may have restored, and he
makes his appearance in the martyrologies in the ninth century as ‘Saint
Kentigern, Bishop of Glasgow and Confessor.’[365]

[Sidenote: Kentigern driven to Wales.]

Jocelyn, after describing Kentigern’s mode of life and how he spread the
faith of Christ in his diocese, tells us that, ‘a considerable time
having elapsed, a certain tyrant, by name Morken, had ascended the
throne of the Cumbrian kingdom,’ who ‘scorned and despised the life and
doctrine of the man of God in much slandering, in public resisting him
from time to time, putting down his miraculous power to magical
illusion, and esteeming as nothing all that he did.’ But after a time
Morken dies and is buried in the royal town, which from him was called
Thorp Morken. ‘After this,’ says Jocelyn, ‘for many days he enjoyed
great peace and quiet, living in his own city of Glasgow, and going
through his diocese;’ but, ‘when some time had passed, certain sons of
Belial, a generation of vipers of the kin of the aforenamed King Morken,
excited by the sting of intense hatred and infected with the poison of
the devil, took counsel together how they might lay hold of Kentigern by
craft and put him to death.’ In consequence of this Kentigern resolved
to leave the north and proceed to Menevia in South Wales, now Saint
David’s, where St. (Length: 1685 characters)
- Rydderch Hael becomes king of Cumbria and recalls Kentigern.]

After some account of Kentigern’s life at his monastery in North Wales,
Jocelyn returns to the north in order to ‘show what his adversaries
suffered, how he returned to the Cumbrian region, and what he did
there.’ He tells us, after an imaginative account of the fate of those
who had driven out Kentigern, that, ‘when the time of having mercy had
arrived, that the Lord might remove the rod of his fierce anger and that
they should turn unto Him and He should heal them, He raised up over the
Cumbrian kingdom a king, Rederech by name, who, having been baptized in
Ireland in the most Christian manner by the disciples of Saint Patrick,
sought the Lord with all his heart and strove to restore Christianity.’
‘Wherefore,’ continues Jocelyn, ‘King Rederech, seeing that the
Christian religion was almost entirely destroyed in his kingdom, set
himself zealously to restore it; and, after long considering the matter
in his own mind and taking advice with other Christians who were in his
confidence, he discovered no more healthful plan by which he could bring
it to a successful result than to send messengers to Saint Kentigern, to
recall him to his first see.’ It was by the great battle of _Ardderyd_,
fought at Arthuret on the river Esk a few miles north of Carlisle, in
which the pagan and Christian parties met in conflict, and a decisive
struggle for the supremacy took place between them, that the victory of
the Christian chiefs placed Rydderch Hael, or the Liberal, on the
throne; and as this battle took place in the year 573, it gives us a
fixed date for the recall of Kentigern. (Length: 1678 characters)
- In it he refers to the cycle ‘introduced into use by our
pope, Saint Patricius;’[29] and Adamnan, writing in the end of the
seventh century, in the second preface to his Life of Columba mentions
‘Maucta, a pilgrim from Britain, a holy man, a disciple of Saint
Patricius the bishop.’[30] These early notices, though few in number,
seem sufficient to prove his existence; but if we are to receive as
genuine documents his Confession and the Epistle to Coroticus, as
undoubtedly we ought, they not only afford conclusive evidence of his
own existence and the reality of his mission, but give us his own
account of the leading particulars of his life.[31] The information he
gives us may be shortly stated thus:—Patricius was born of Christian
parents and belonged to a Christian people; for he ‘was the son of
Calpornius a deacon, son of the late Potitus a presbyter, who lived in
the village of Bannavem of Tabernia, where he had a small farm.’[32] He
was of gentle birth, his father being also a ‘decurio,’ that is, one of
the council or magistracy of a Roman provincial town.[33] He lived at
this little farm when, in his sixteenth year, he was taken captive and
brought to Hibernia or Ireland with many thousands; and he adds, ‘as we
deserved, for we had forsaken God, and had not kept his commandments,
and were disobedient to our priests, who admonished us for our
salvation.’ He remained six years in slavery in Ireland, where he was
employed tending sheep; and then he escaped in a ship, the sailors of
which were pagans, and after three days reached land, and for
twenty-eight days journeyed through a desert. (Length: 1638 characters)
- By all these things the pagans were
seduced and paid divine honour to the fountain.’ Columba blesses the
fountain in the name of Christ; and, having washed his hands and feet,
he and his companions drank of the water he had blessed. ‘And from that
day,’ adds Adamnan, ‘the demons departed from the fountain,’ and people,
instead of being injured, were cured of many diseases by it.[234] Then
we find Broichan, the ‘Magus,’ or _Drui_, of King Brude, informing
Columba that he will prevent him from making his voyage along Loch Ness;
‘for,’ he says, ‘I can make the winds unfavourable to thy voyage, and
cause a great darkness to envelope thee in its shade.’ The Saint goes to
the lake with a large number of followers, and the ‘Magi’ begin to
exult, seeing that it had become very dark and that the wind was very
violent and contrary. ‘Nor should we wonder,’ says Adamnan, ‘that God
sometimes allows them, with the aid of evil spirits, to raise tempests
and agitate the sea.’ Columba calls on Christ the Lord, and embarks in
his small boat, which at once carries him along against the wind.[235]

These Christian missionaries appear not to have denied the reality of
those powers exercised by the Druids through their earth gods, but to
have attributed them to the agency of evil spirits, and to have believed
that their gods were demons; and this seems to have called forth the
counter-superstition that these old Celtic saints held familiar
intercourse with the angels of God, and in their turn received powerful
aid from them—a belief which these saints themselves perhaps were not
unwilling to recognise. (Length: 1631 characters)
- Schism still exists in Iona.]

‘It appears to have been a wonderful dispensation of the Divine
goodness, that the same nation which had wittingly and without envy
communicated to the people of the Angles the knowledge of the true
Deity, should afterwards, by means of the nation of the Angles, be
brought, in those points on which they were defective, to the rule of
life;’ such is the reflection of the Venerable Bede when contemplating
the change which had taken place in the Columban Church in the beginning
of the eighth century, which he thus expresses: ‘The monks of _Hii_, or
Iona, by the instruction of Ecgberct, adopted the Catholic rites under
Abbot Dunchad, about eighty years after they had sent Bishop Aidan to
preach to the nation of the Angles.’[505] He had previously stated that,
not long after the year 710, ‘those monks also of the Scottish nation
who lived in the island of Hii, with the other monasteries that were
subject to them, were, by the procurement of our Lord, brought to the
canonical observance of Easter and the right mode of tonsure;[506] and
this had been effected by the most reverend and holy father and priest
Ecgberct, of the nation of the Angles, who had long lived in banishment
in Ireland for the sake of Christ, and was most learned in the
Scriptures and distinguished for the perfection of a long life, and who
came among them, corrected their error, and changed them to the true and
canonical day of Easter.’[507] Bede implies that this took place in the
year 716; but the change was not so general or so instantaneous as might
be inferred from this statement. (Length: 1629 characters)
