THE RELIGION OF PLUTARCH




CHAPTER I.

    _General character of Modern European Religions: their cardinal
    appeal to Emotion—Roman Religion: its sanctions chiefly
    rational: the causes of its failure: its place as a factor
    in Morality taken by Greek Philosophy—Early Greek Morality
    based partly on Religion, partly on Reason, which, in the form
    of Philosophy, eventually supplies the main inspiration to
    Goodness—Gradual limitation of Philosophy to Ethics._


The various religious revivals which the European world has witnessed
during the prolonged course of the Christian era; the great attempts
which the modern conscience has made from time to time to bring itself
into a more intimate and fruitful relation with the principles that
make for goodness of character and righteousness of life: have, in
general, taken the form less of reasoned invocations to the cultivated
intelligence than of emotional appeals to the natural passions and
prepossessions of humanity. (Length: 7470 characters)
- In the “Isis and Osiris,” for example,
he argues for the probability of the view which assigns the legends of
these two deities not to gods or men, but to Dæmons;[258] and proceeds
still further to breach the partition wall between the two natures by
introducing into his Dæmonology such legends as have raised Osiris and
Isis, on account of their virtue, from the rank of good Dæmons to that of
the gods,[259] and describes them as receiving everywhere the combined
honours of gods and Dæmons; and he appropriates the argument to Greek
religion by comparing this promotion to those of Herakles and Dionysus;
by identifying Isis with Proserpine, and subsequently Osiris with
Dionysus.[260]

But whatever may have been the views explicitly maintained by Plutarch in
this connexion, it is his constant practice to shift on to the shoulders
of the Dæmons the responsibility for all those legends, ceremonies, and
practices, which, however appropriate and necessary parts of the national
faith they may be, are yet inconsistent with the qualities rightly
attributable to Deity.[261] We have already noticed his unwillingness
to impugn the immutability of the Creator by regarding His essence as
capable of metamorphosis into the phenomena of the created world.[262]
“It is,” says Ammonius, “the function of some other god to do and suffer
these changes—or, rather, of some Dæmon appointed to direct Nature in
the processes of generation and destruction.” This relationship of the
Dæmons to the supreme power as conceived by philosophy is more completely
stated in the short tract, “De Fato,”[263] where we are told that (1)
there is a first and supreme Providence which is the intelligence of
the First Deity, or, as one may regard it, His benevolent will towards
all creatures, in accordance with which all _divine_ things universally
received the most admirable and perfect order; (2) the second Providence
is that of the second gods, who move through the sky, by which _human_
affairs are duly ordered, including those relating to the permanence
and preservation of the various species; (3) the third Providence may
properly be regarded as the superintendence of the Dæmons who are
situated near the earth, observing and directing the actions of men. (Length: 2282 characters)
- Hunc igitur terrorem animi tenebrasque necesse est
    Non radii solis neque lucida tela diei
    Discutiant, sed naturæ species ratioque.”

Lucretius, whose great poem is devoted to an exposition of the physical
side of Epicureanism, _i.e._ of the Atomic Philosophy of Democritus,[90]
is only on the same ground with Epicurus himself when he makes it clear,
not merely by the general complexion of his argument, but by a large
number of particular passages, and those, too, the most strikingly
beautiful in the poem, that the investigation of natural phenomena is to
serve only as a means of freeing the life of humanity from those cares
and vices which are hostile to its peace:—

    “Denique avarities et honorum cæca cupido
    Quæ miseros homines cogunt transcendere fines
    Juris et interdum socios scelerum atque ministros
    Noctes atque dies niti præstante labore
    Ad summas emergere opes, hæc vulnera vitæ
    Non minimam partem _mortis formidine_ aluntur.”

The investigation of nature with a view to eliminating the fear of
death as a factor in human conduct, clearly enounced as it is in the
poem of the Roman Epicurean, is still more emphatically expressed
in a “fundamental maxim” of Epicurus himself: “If we did not allow
ourselves to be disturbed by suspicious fears of celestial phenomena;
if the terrors of death were never in our minds; and if we would but
courageously discuss the limits of our nature as regards pain and desire:
we should then have no need to study Natural Philosophy.”[91]

The exclusion of Dialectics,[92] and the subordination of Physics to
Ethics, restricted—if, indeed, it were a restriction—the scope of
character and intelligence to the sphere of conduct, and it is in the
light of this limitation that the full significance of the Epicurean
definition of Philosophy lies—“Philosophy is an active principle
which aims at securing Happiness by Reason and Discussion.” Here we
have in practical completion that identification of Philosophy with
Ethics towards which the whole tendency of Greek speculation had been
consciously or unconsciously working, and which was fully consummated in
the later development of the Stoic and Epicurean systems. (Length: 2234 characters)
- This tendency
would be also probably aided by the fact that in Homer, as Plutarch
points out, and in the dramatists and prose writers generally, as is
well known, the designations of “gods” and “dæmons” were mutually
interchanged.[243] Plutarch, at all events, who boldly uses the Dæmons
to perform such functions, and to bear the blame for such actions, as
were inappropriate to the divine character, is enabled to make one of
his _dramatis personæ_—Cleombrotus, the traveller, who was specially
devoted to the study of such matters—assert that “it can be demonstrated
by unexceptionable testimony from antiquity that there do exist beings
of a nature intermediate between that of God and man, beings subject
to mortal passions and liable to inevitable changes, but whom we must,
_in accordance with the established custom of our fathers_, regard and
invoke as Dæmons, giving them all due reverence.”[244] It is natural,
therefore, in the light of these indications, to believe that, side by
side with the popular gods, there existed, in the popular imagination,
subordinate beings of two kinds, both described as Dæmons: the first
class comprising the good and benevolent Dæmons of Hesiod, the second
including Dæmons of an evil character and disposition, the belief in
which had developed naturally out of the Hesiodic conception, from the
necessity of fixing the responsibility of evil deeds on supernatural
beings different in nature from the purity and goodness of Deity.[245]
Such a classification of supernatural beings—gods, Dæmons, and evil
Dæmons—could not, of course, be rigidly maintained; the more the good
Dæmons were discriminated from their evil brethren, the more they would
tend to become identified with the gods of the popular tradition, and the
line of demarcation between the divine and the dæmonic nature would be
broken down,[246] Dæmons and gods would be identified, and the splendour
and purity of the Supreme God of all would shine out more fully when
contrasted with those other gods, who, after all, were only Dæmons. (Length: 2076 characters)
- He
alludes coldly, perhaps even sneeringly, to such of his contemporaries
as fancied they could apply the ancient traditions of glory to those
late and unseasonable times, like little children who would try to
wear their father’s sandals;[162] counsels a complete submission to
the duly appointed Roman authorities; fully persuaded that within the
limits of their supremacy there is as much freedom as a reasonable man
could desire to enjoy; and honestly claims to find scope, in a little
Bœotian township, for such political ambition as could be safely and
wisely indulged.[163] It is not difficult to sneer at the prudential
limitation of patriotism to such petty, insignificant, and meagre efforts
as the superintendence of bricks and mortar and the carting of municipal
rubbish; but the wiser thing is to note that Plutarch’s opposition to
vain fancies of the revival of the ancient Hellenic splendour, except
perhaps in such a form as a Hadrian might be inclined to revive it in
an artificial Panhellenium, is based on the conviction that happiness
depends upon the free development of individual character, the
unrestricted enjoyment of domestic peace, the undisturbed intercourse
of social life; and he knew that the Roman sway made it possible, for
Greeks at any rate, to enjoy these blessings to a degree never previously
known in their chequered history.[164] With a clear recognition of the
historical causes of the political decadence of Hellenism, he regards
civic discord as the evil which most demands the attention of those
who still seek opportunities for public action, and he is particularly
grateful to the strong hand of Rome for controlling the internecine
animosities of Greek cities. “Consider,” says he, “our position with
regard to those blessings which are counted as the greatest that a city
can enjoy: Peace, Freedom, Fertility of Soil, Increase of Population,
Domestic Concord. (Length: 1935 characters)
- Martineau (_Types of Ethical Theory_, vol. i. p. 91) thinks
that “we must go a little further than Zeller, who decides that Plato
usually conceived of God as if personal, yet was restrained by a doctrine
inconsistent with such conception from approaching it closely or
setting it deliberately on any scientific ground,” and devotes several
closely-reasoned pages to show that, although there was no room for
a personal god in Plato’s philosophy, Plato himself was in distinct
opposition to his own views as systematically expounded in his writings.
“We may regard him as fully aware of the conditions of the problem,
and, though unable to solve it without lesion of his dialectic, yet
deliberately pronouncing judgment on the side of his religious feeling.”
But _pace tantorum virorum_ it will be admitted that the personality of
God is not very evident in Plato when those who understand him best can
only maintain that it is not essentially interwoven with his philosophy,
having only an indirect and accidental existence which is not possible
“without lesion of his dialectic.”

[374] “Abstractedly, the theology of the Stoics appears as a
materialistic pantheism; God is represented as a fire, and the world
as a mode of God.” (GRANT, _The Ethics of Aristotle_, vol. i. p. 265.)
In the famous “hymn of Cleanthes,” preserved, like so many other of
the great wonders of classical literature, by Stobæus, Grant sees an
emphatic recognition of the personality of God, but it is equally natural
to regard the hymn as a more detailed expression of that necessity of
submitting to Destiny—of living in accordance with nature—which Cleanthes
enounces in that other famous fragment which Epictetus would have us hold
ready to hand in all the circumstances of life:—

    “Lead me, O Zeus, and thou O Destiny,
    The way that I am bid by you to go:
    To follow I am ready. (Length: 1899 characters)
- Their method was wrong, according to the “Magna Moralia,”
since there is a special and appropriate method for the analysis and
discussion of the virtues, and “Justice is not a number evenly even.”[66]
Such a definition, thus crushed by way of a point-blank negative, has,
of course, nothing but a metaphorical significance as applied to Ethics;
but the metaphorical conception of Justice as a perfect number will
not be totally devoid of inspiration to justice of conduct in the mind
of one who loves perfection even when represented by an arithmetical
abstraction; and if by this definition “it was designed to express the
correspondence between action and suffering,”[67] a fruitful, though
incomplete, ethical principle is embodied in their mathematical
phrasing.[68] In a more general sense, Epicharmus has sung how the
Pythagorean Doctrine of Number may be applied to the domain of practice:—

    “Man’s life needs greatly Number’s ordered sway:
    His path is safe who follows Number’s way.”[69]

But the Pythagorean doctrine of Transmigration probably had a greater
ethical value than the metaphysical conceptions of Number which
constituted the Pythagorean οὐσία; although it is not impossible that
the dogma, when carelessly held or unphilosophically interpreted, might
have a vicious rather than a virtuous effect.[70] The “Golden Verses of
Pythagoras,” whether composed by any individual member of the school,
or officially embodying the teaching of the sect, or representing the
actual work of some philosopher not formally a Pythagorean, have been
universally recognised to express a Pythagorean ideal;[71] and thus
exhibit in the doctrine of the Italian School a far more vigorous and
fruitful ethical tendency than any study of its official doctrines—so far
as they are available for study—would lead us to suppose. (Length: 1860 characters)
- Persius, whose disposition was marked by maidenly
modesty and gentleness, and who is also described as _frugi et pudicus_,
shows, even when hampered by a disjointed style which only allows him to
utter his thought in fragments, that devotion to the highest moral aims
which we should expect from a writer brought up under the influences
which he enjoyed;[113] and though he, too, exhibits some of the savage
ferocity of Juvenal in his strictures of vice, he yet pays, in his Fifth
Satire, that tribute to virtue in the person of Cornutus which “proves
the goodness of the writer and the gracefulness with which he could
write.”[114] Lucan, too, whose youth, like that of Persius, had the
inestimable advantage of receiving a share of the wisdom which Cornutus
had gained by nights devoted to philosophic studies, exhibits a spirit
of the loftiest morality under the rhetorical phrasing of his great
Republican Epic.[115] Looking back, with something of regret, to the days
of a dominant oligarchy, he does not conceal the licentiousness which
society harboured beneath the sway of the later Optimates, and he turns
mostly to Cato as the type which he would fain accept as representative
of the true Roman patrician:—

    “Nam cui crediderim Superos arcana daturos
    Dicturosque magis quam sancto vera Catoni?”[116]

The noble lines in which Cato refuses to consult the Libyan oracle—_Non
exploratum populis Ammona relinquens_—are well known, and express a
highly ethical view of the divine administration of the world:—

    “Hæremus cuncti superis, temploque tacente
    Nil facimus non sponte Dei: nec vocibus ullis
    Numen agit: dixitque semel nascentibus auctor
    Quicquid scire licet: steriles nec legit arenas
    Ut caneret paucis, mersitque hoc pulvere verum. (Length: 1804 characters)
- Christian translators of the piece, from
Amyot down to the writers just quoted, have hailed it as an effective
vindication of the ways of God to man, and Comte Joseph de Maistre, whose
paraphrase is designed, as he says, to please “ladies and foreigners,”
is quite convinced that such a justification could not possibly have
been written by one who was not a Christian.[202] Even Wyttenbach, whom
de Maistre attacks for repudiating this view, is willing, with all his
scholarly caution, to admit that Plutarch, in this tract, touches the
excellences of the Christian faith.[203]

The position which Plutarch sets himself to overthrow is that which is
expressed most concisely in the famous verses of Ennius:—

    “Ego deum genus esse semper dixi et dicam cœlitum,
    Sed eos non curare opinor quid agat humanum genus;
    Nam si curent, bene bonis sit, male malis, quod nunc abest”

—a sentiment in exact harmony with the Epicurean view of the matter.[204]
While, however, establishing the providence and goodness of God as
against the practical Atheism of the Epicureans, it will be seen that he
is equally temperate, and equally consistent with himself, in avoiding
the exaggerated zeal of those Stoics who, in their eager desire to do
something for the honour of Providence, had subjected the minutest
and commonest actions of life to the jealous watching of an arbitrary
omniscience, so that, as Wyttenbach puts it, “that most gracious name
of Providence was exposed to ridicule and contempt, being alternately
regarded as a _fortune-telling old crone_, and as _a dreadful spectre to
alarm and terrify mankind_.”

Let us see in what way Plutarch establishes the providential benevolence
of God without detracting from his majesty. (Length: 1766 characters)
- But Paganism girt on its armour in direct
hostility to the new Creed, and from these clenched antagonisms sprang
that accentuation of points of difference which broke the continuity of
civilization, and separated the modern from the classical world by a
chasm which the efforts of four centuries have not succeeded in bridging
over.[392] Is it not possible that Paganism, which out of the multitude
of separate gods had evolved the idea of the One Pure and Perfect
Deity, might also, out of the many-sided activities of the half-human,
half-divine Dæmons, have arrived at the belief in a single mediatory
power, and, with a perception unblinded by polemic bitterness, have been
prepared to merge this conception in the Divine Man of the Catholic
Church?[393]

But though the spirit of Plutarch was not destined in this way to pass
directly on to the believer in Christianity, the time was to come when,
among the best and purest adherents of that faith, his teachings would be
regarded as efficacious for the sincerest goodness. “The works of Jeremy
Taylor,” says Archbishop Trench, “contain no less than two hundred and
fifty-six allusions or direct references made by him to the writings of
Plutarch.” But direct indebtedness of this kind does not necessarily
imply similarity of spirit, and fortunately the mental attitude of
Plutarch is one which appears essential to human progress, and does not
depend upon the continuity of a tradition. “Plutarch,” wrote Emerson,
“will be perpetually rediscovered from time to time as long as books
last.”[394] He will be perpetually rediscovered because there will be a
perpetually recurring necessity to look at life from his point of view. (Length: 1708 characters)
