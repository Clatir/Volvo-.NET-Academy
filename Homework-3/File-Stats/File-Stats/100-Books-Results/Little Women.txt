CHAPTER ONE
PLAYING PILGRIMS


“Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents,” grumbled Jo, lying
on the rug.

“It’s so dreadful to be poor!” sighed Meg, looking down at her old
dress.

“I don’t think it’s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty
things, and other girls nothing at all,” added little Amy, with an
injured sniff.

“We’ve got Father and Mother, and each other,” said Beth contentedly
from her corner. (Length: 1801 characters)
- Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy looked
both touched and surprised by the report of May’s word and manner.

“Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables
as generously as you have by mine, especially the art table,” she said,
ordering out ‘Teddy’s own’, as the girls called the college friends.

“‘Charge, Chester, charge!’ is the motto for that table, but do your
duty like men, and you’ll get your money’s worth of art in every sense
of the word,” said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx
prepared to take the field.

“To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May,” said little
Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and
getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said...

“Very well, my son, for a small boy!” and walked him off, with a
paternal pat on the head.

“Buy the vases,” whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals
of fire on her enemy’s head. (Length: 976 characters)
- Somehow it seemed as if they couldn’t have got through the day without
that, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that
motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.

“If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would
serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never
seen,” cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and
bitter wind.

“Don’t use such dreadful expressions,” replied Meg from the depths of
the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the
world.

“I like good strong words that mean something,” replied Jo, catching
her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away
altogether.

“Call yourself any names you like, but I am neither a rascal nor a
wretch and I don’t choose to be called so.”

“You’re a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because you can’t
sit in the lap of luxury all the time. (Length: 947 characters)
- We’ll stop at Meg’s, and borrow her white sunshade, and then you can
have my dove-colored one.”

While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them, not
without entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled
into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet
strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she
put on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out
the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the
present mission was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her
hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last
touch of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of
countenance, saying meekly...

“I’m perfectly miserable, but if you consider me presentable, I die
happy.”

“You’re highly satisfactory. (Length: 874 characters)
- Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know
everything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get
satisfactory answers to his perpetual “What for?”

He also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his
grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him, in which
the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to the undisguised
satisfaction of the womenfolk.

“What makes my legs go, Dranpa?” asked the young philosopher, surveying
those active portions of his frame with a meditative air, while resting
after a go-to-bed frolic one night.

“It’s your little mind, Demi,” replied the sage, stroking the yellow
head respectfully.

“What is a little mine?”

“It is something which makes your body move, as the spring made the
wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you.”

“Open me. (Length: 874 characters)
- Meg received his humble apology, and was much
comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.

“I’ll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan’t drag it out of
me, so you’ll forgive me, Meg, and I’ll do anything to show how
out-and-out sorry I am,” he added, looking very much ashamed of
himself.

“I’ll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn’t think
you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,” replied Meg, trying to hide
her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.

“It was altogether abominable, and I don’t deserve to be spoken to for
a month, but you will, though, won’t you?” And Laurie folded his hands
together with such and imploring gesture, as he spoke in his
irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him
in spite of his scandalous behavior. (Length: 848 characters)
- Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she
cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the
opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which
poverty now excluded her.

“My lady,” as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine
lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy
refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and
that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.

“I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma,” Amy said, coming in with an
important air one day.

“Well, little girl, what is it?” replied her mother, in whose eyes the
stately young lady still remained ‘the baby’.

“Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate
for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day. (Length: 847 characters)
- The pale roses Amy gave him were
the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal wreaths,
and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself, but
the next instant his American common sense got the better of
sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard
since he came.

“It’s good advice, you’d better take it and save your fingers,” she
said, thinking her speech amused him.

“Thank you, I will,” he answered in jest, and a few months later he did
it in earnest.

“Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?” she asked presently,
as she settled herself on a rustic seat.

“Very soon.”

“You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.”

“I dare say, short answers save trouble.”

“He expects you, and you really ought to go.”

“Hospitable creature! (Length: 842 characters)
- There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came
out, the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day, her lover’s
diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the queer lockets, with
portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside, the
baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn, Uncle March’s big
watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with, and in
a box all by itself lay Aunt March’s wedding ring, too small now for
her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of
them all.

“Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?” asked Esther,
who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.

“I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I’m
fond of necklaces, they are so becoming. (Length: 814 characters)
- I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I
gave all my money to get it, and I’m truly trying not to be selfish any
more.”

As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap
one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget
herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her ‘a
trump’, while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to
ornament the stately bottle.

“You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about
being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the
minute I was up, and I’m so glad, for mine is the handsomest now.”

Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the
girls to the table, eager for breakfast.

“Merry Christmas, Marmee! (Length: 809 characters)
