- And in this heicher stratosphere
    As bairn at giant at thee I peer....

    _O Jean, in whom my spirit sees,
    Clearer than through whisky or disease,
    Its dernin’ nature, wad the searchin’ licht
    Oor union raises poor’d owre me the nicht._

    _I’m faced wi’ aspects o’ mysel’
    At last wha’s portent nocht can tell,
    Save that sheer licht o’ life that when we’re joint
    Loups through me like a fire a’ else t’ aroint._

    _Clear my lourd flesh, and let me move
    In the peculiar licht o’ love,
    As aiblins in Eternity men may
    When their swack souls nae mair are clogged wi’ clay._

    _Be thou the licht in which I stand
    Entire, in thistle-shape, as planned,
    And no’ hauf-hidden and hauf-seen as here
    In munelicht, whisky, and in fleshly fear,_

    _In fear to look owre closely at
    The grisly form in which I’m caught,
    In sic a reelin’ and imperfect licht
    Sprung frae incongruous elements the nicht!_

    _But wer’t by thou they were shone on,
    Then wad I ha’e nae dreid to con
    The ugsome problems shapin’ in my soul,
    Or gin I hed—certes, nae fear you’d thole!_

    _Be in this fibre like an eye,
    And ilka turn and twist descry,
    Hoo here a leaf, a spine, a rose—or as
    The purpose o’ the poo’er that brings ’t to pass._

    _Syne liberate me frae this tree,
    As wha had there imprisoned me,
    The end achieved—or show me at the least
    Mair meanin’ in’t, and hope o’ bein’ released._

    I tae ha’e heard Eternity drip water
    (Aye water, water!), drap by drap
    On the a’e nerve, like lichtnin’, I’ve become,
    And heard God passin’ wi’ a bobby’s feet
    Ootby in the lang coffin o’ the street
    —Seen stang by chitterin’ knottit stang loup oot
    Uncrushed by th’ echoes o’ the thunderin’ boot,
    Till a’ the dizzy lint-white lines o’ torture made
    A monstrous thistle in the space aboot me,
    A symbol o’ the puzzle o’ man’s soul
    —And in my agony been pridefu’ I could still
    Tine nae least quiver or twist, watch ilka point
    Like a white-het bodkin ripe my inmaist hert,
    And aye wi’ clearer pain that brocht nae anodyne,
    But rose for ever to a fer crescendo
    Like eagles that ootsoar wi’ skinklan’ wings
    The thieveless sun they blin’
              —And pridefu’ still
    That ’yont the sherp wings o’ the eagles fleein’
    Aboot the dowless pole o’ Space,
    Like leafs aboot a thistle-shank, my bluid
    Could still thraw roses up
              —And up! (Length: 2561 characters)
- Spring’s spirit wi’ its waesome sough
      Rules owre the drucken stramash there._

      _And heich abune the vennel’s pokiness,
      Whaur a’ the white-weshed cottons lie;
      The Inn’s sign blinters in the mochiness,
      And lood and shrill the bairnies cry._

      _The hauflins ’yont the burgh boonds
      Gang ilka nicht, and a’ the same,
      Their bonnets cocked; their bluid that stounds
      Is playin’ at a fine auld game._

      _And on the lochan there, hauf-herted
      Wee screams and creakin’ oar-locks soon’,
      And in the lift, heich, hauf-averted,
      The mune looks owre the yirdly roon’._

      _And ilka evenin’, derf and serious
      (Jean ettles nocht o’ this, puir lass),
      In liquor, raw yet still mysterious,
      A’e freend’s aye mirrored in my glass._

      _Ahint the sheenin’ coonter gruff
      Thrang barmen ding the tumblers doun
      “In vino veritas” cry rough
      And reid-een’d fules that in it droon._

      _But ilka evenin’ fey and fremt
      (Is it a dream nae wauk’nin’ proves?)
      As to a trystin’-place undreamt,
      A silken leddy darkly moves._

      _Slow gangs she by the drunken anes,
      And lanely by the winnock sits;
      Frae’r robes, atour the sunken anes,
      A rooky dwamin’ perfume flits._

      _Her gleamin’ silks, the taperin’
      O’ her ringed fingers, and her feathers
      Move dimly like a dream wi’in,
      While endless faith aboot them gethers._

      _I seek, in this captivity,
      To pierce the veils that darklin’ fa’
      —See white clints slidin’ to the sea,
      And hear the horns o’ Elfland blaw._

      _I ha’e dark secrets’ turns and twists,
      A sun is gi’en to me to haud,
      The whisky in my bluid insists,
      And spiers my benmaist history, lad._

      _And owre my brain the flitterin’
      O’ the dim feathers gangs aince mair,
      And, faddomless, the dark blue glitterin’
      O’ twa een in the ocean there._

      _My soul stores up this wealth unspent,
      The key is safe and nane’s but mine. (Length: 2111 characters)
- For mine’s the clearest insicht
    O’ man’s facility
    For constant self-deception,
    And hoo his mind can be
    But as a floatin’ iceberg
    That hides aneth the sea
    Its bulk: and hoo frae depths
    O’ an unfaddomed flood
    Tensions o’ nerves arise
    And humours o’ the blood
    —Keethin’s nane can trace
    To their original place.

    _Hoo mony men to mak’ a man
    It tak’s he kens wha kens Life’s plan._

    But there are flegsome deeps
    Whaur the soul o’ Scotland sleeps
    That I to bottom need
    To wauk Guid kens what deid,
    Play at stertle-a-stobie,
    Wi’ nation’s dust for hobby,
    Or wi’ God’s sel’ commerce
    For the makin’ o’ a verse.

    _“Melville, sea-compelling man,
    Before whose wand Leviathan
    Rose hoary-white upon the Deep,”[14]
    What thou hast sown I fain ’ud reap
    O’ knowledge ’yont the human mind
    In keepin’ wi’ oor Scottish kind,
    And, thanks to thee, may aiblins reach
    To what this Russian has to teach,
    Closer than ony ither Scot,
    Closer to me than my ain thocht,
    Closer than my ain braith to me,
    As close as to the Deity
    Approachable in whom appears
    This Christ o’ the neist thoosand years._

    As frae your baggit wife
    You turned whenever able,
    And often when you werena,
    Unto the gamin’ table,
    And opened wide to ruin
    Your benmaist hert, aye brewin’
    A horror o’ whatever
    Seemed likely to deliver
    You frae the senseless strife
    In which alane is life,
    —As Burns in Edinburgh
    Breenged arse-owre-heid thoro’
    A’ _it_ could be the spur o’
    To pleuch his sauted furrow,
    And turned frae a’ men honour
    To what could only scunner
    Wha thinks that common-sense
    Can e’er be but a fence
    To keep a soul worth ha’en
    Frae what it s’ud be daein’
    —Sae I in turn maun gie
    My soul to misery,
    Daidle disease
    Upon my knees,
    And welcome madness
    Wi’ exceedin’ gladness
    —Aye, open wide my hert
    To a’ the thistle’s smert. (Length: 2087 characters)
- The roses like the saints in Heaven treid
    Triumphant owre the agonies o’ their breed,
    And wag fu’ mony a celestial heid
    Abune the thorter-ills o’ leaf and prick
    In which they ken the feck maun stick.

    _Yank oot your orra boughs, my hert!_

    A mongrel growth, jumble o’ disproportions,
    Whirlin’ in its incredible contortions,
    Or wad-be client that an auld whore shuns,
    Wardin’ her wizened orange o’ a bosom
    Frae importunities sae gruesome,

    Or new diversion o’ the hormones
    Mair fond o’ procreation than the Mormons,
    And fetchin’ like a devastatin’ storm on’s
    A’ the uncouth dilemmas o’ oor natur’
    Objectified in vegetable maitter.

    _Yank oot your orra boughs, my hert!_

    And heed nae mair the foolish cries that beg
    You slice nae mair to aff or pu’ to leg,
    You skitin’ duffer that gar’s a’body fleg,
    —What tho’ you ding the haill warld oot o’ joint
    Wi’ a skier to cover-point!

    _Yank oot your orra boughs, my hert!_

    There _was_ a danger—and it’s weel I see’t—
    Had brocht ye like Mallarmé to defeat:—
    “Mon doute, amas de nuit ancienne s’achève
    En maint rameau subtil, qui, demeuré les vrais
    Bois même, prouve, hélas! que bien seul je m’offrais
    Pour triomphe le faute idéale des roses.”[8]

- In a’ the inklin’s cryptic,
    Then, o’ an epileptic,
    I ha’e been stood in you
    And droukit in their grue
    Till I can see richt through
    Ilk weakness o’ my frame
    And ilka dernin’ shame,
    And can employ the same
    To jouk the curse o’ fame,
    Lowsed frae the dominion
    O’ popular opinion,
    And risen at last abune
    The thistle like a mune
    That looks serenely doon
    On what queer things there are
    In an inferior star
    That couldna be, or see,
    Themsel’s, except in me.

    _Wi’ burnt-oot hert and poxy face
    I sall illumine a’ the place,
    And there is ne’er a fount o’ grace
    That isna in a similar case._

    Let a’ the thistle’s growth
    Be as a process, then,
    My spirit’s gane richt through,
    And needna threid again,
    Tho’ in it sall be haud’n
    For aye the feck o’ men
    Wha’s queer contortions there
    As memories I ken,
    As memories o’ my ain
    O’ mony an ancient pain. (Length: 992 characters)
- Impersonality sall blaw
    Through me as ’twere a bluffert o’ snaw
    To scour me o’ my sense o’ awe,

    A bluffert o’ snaw, the licht that flees
    Within the Wheel, and Freedom gi’es
    Frae Dust and Daith and a’ Disease,

    —The drumlie doom that only weighs
    On them wha ha’ena seen their place
    Yet in creation’s lichtnin’ race,

    In the movement that includes
    As a tide’s resistless floods
    A’ their movements and their moods,—

    Until disinterested we,
    O’ a’ oor auld delusions free,
    Lowe in the wheel’s serenity

    As conscious items in the licht,
    And keen to keep it clear and bricht
    In which the haill machine is dight,

    The licht nae man has ever seen
    Till he has felt that he’s been gi’en
    The stars themsels insteed o’ een,

    And often wi’ the sun has glowered
    At the white mune until it cowered,
    As when by new thocht auld’s o’erpowered. (Length: 948 characters)
- Opens the aumrie door,
    And lo! the skeleton’s there,
    And the gude dog, Truth, has gotten
    Banes for evermair....

    _Maun I tae perish in the keel o’ Heaven,
    And is this fratt upon the air the ply
    O’ cross-brath’d cordage that in gloffs and gowls
    Brak’s up the vision o’ the warld’s bricht gy?_

    _Ship’s tackle and an eemis cairn o’ fraucht
    Darker than clamourin’ veins are roond me yet,
    A plait o’ shadows thicker than the flesh,
    A fank o’ tows that binds me hand and fit._

    _What gin the gorded fullyery on hie
    And a’ the fanerels o’ the michty ship
    Gi’e back mair licht than fa’s upon them ev’n
    Gin sic black ingangs haud us in their grip?_

    Grugous thistle, to my een
    Your widdifow ramel evince,
    Sibness to snakes wha’s coils
    Rin coonter airts at yince,
    And fain I’d follow each
    Gin you the trick’ll teach. (Length: 916 characters)
- In this sorry growth
    Whatna beauty is tint
    That freed o’t micht find
    A waur fate than is in’t?...

    _Yank oot your orra boughs, my hert!_

    God gied man speech and speech created thocht,
    He gied man speech but to the Scots gied nocht
    Barrin’ this clytach that they’ve never brocht
    To onything but sic a Blottie O
    As some bairn’s copybook micht show,

    A spook o’ soond that frae the unkent grave
    In which oor nation lies loups up to wave
    Sic leprous chuns as tatties have
    That cellar-boond send spindles gropin’
    Towards ony hole that’s open,

    Like waesome fingers in the dark that think
    They still may widen the ane and only chink
    That e’er has gi’en mankind a blink
    O’ Hope—tho’ ev’n in that puir licht
    They s’ud ha’e seen their hopeless plicht. (Length: 842 characters)
- What earthquake chitters oot
    In the Thistle’s oorie shape,
    What gleids o’ central fire
    In its reid heids escape,
    And whatna coonter forces
    In growth and ingrowth graip
    In an eternal clinch
    In this ootcuissen form
    That winna be outcast,
    But triumphs at the last
    (Owre a’ abies itsel’
    As fer as we can tell,
    Sin’ frae the Eden o’ the world
    Ilka man in turn is hurled,
    And ilka gairden rins to waste
    That was ever to his taste?)

    _O keep the Thistle ’yont the wa’
    Owre which your skeletons you’ll thraw._

    I, in the Thistle’s land,
    As you[13] in Russia where
    Struggle in giant form
    Proceeds for evermair,
    In my sma’ measure ’bood
    Address a similar task,
    And for a share o’ your
    Appallin’ genius ask. (Length: 823 characters)
