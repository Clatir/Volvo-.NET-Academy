Top 10 Longest Sentences:
- He thought that this was in consequence of my share in a
plot of high treason against the King of Saxony, whom he looked upon as
my benefactor, because I had been nominated conductor of the royal
orchestra, and he expressed his opinion about me by ejaculating in
tones of the deepest anguish: ‘Quelle ingratitude!’

From Berlioz, who was at Spontini’s deathbed until the end, I heard
that the master had struggled most determinedly against death, and had
cried repeatedly, ‘Je ne veux pas mourir, je ne veux pas mourir!’ When
Berlioz tried to comfort him by saying, ‘Comment pouvez-vous penser
mourir vous, mon maître, qui etes immortel!’ Spontini retorted angrily,
‘Ne faites pas de mauvaises plaisanteries!’ In spite of all the
extraordinary experiences I had had with him, the news of his death,
which I received in Zürich, touched me very deeply. (Length: 863 characters)
- Just at that time I happened to be
in a position to give some correct details regarding this apparent
sacrifice on the part of Mendelssohn, because when I had made a serious
proposal to our general management about increasing the salaries of
several of the poorer members of the orchestra, Lüttichau was requested
to inform me that, according to the King’s latest commands, the
expenditure on the state bands was to be so restricted that for the
present the poorer chamber musicians could not claim any consideration,
for Herr von Falkenstein, the governor of the Leipzig district, who was
a passionate admirer of Mendelssohn’s, had gone so far as to influence
the King to appoint the latter secret conductor, with a secret salary
of six thousand marks. (Length: 764 characters)
- A
fair-haired German of ancient Swabian stock, heir to the Norman realm
of Sicily and Naples, who gave the Italian language its first
development, and laid a basis for the evolution of knowledge and art
where hitherto ecclesiastical fanaticism and feudal brutality had alone
contended for power, a monarch who gathered at his court the poets and
sages of eastern lands, and surrounded himself with the living products
of Arabian and Persian grace and spirit—this man I beheld betrayed by
the Roman clergy to the infidel foe, yet ending his crusade, to their
bitter disappointment, by a pact of peace with the Sultan, from whom he
obtained a grant of privileges to Christians in Palestine such as the
bloodiest victory could scarcely have secured. (Length: 757 characters)

PREFACE


The contents of these volumes have been written down directly from my
dictation, over a period of several years, by my friend and wife, who
wished me to tell her the story of my life. (Length: 753 characters)
- When in the evening we had
supped off trout at the Wilhelmsburg, drunk good Czernosek wine with
Bilin water, and duly excited ourselves over Hoffmann, Beethoven,
Shakespeare, Heinse’s Ardinghello, and other matters, and then, with
our limbs comfortably outstretched in our elegant carriage, drove back
in the summer twilight to the ‘King of Prussia,’ where we occupied the
large balcony-room on the first floor, we felt that we had spent the
day like young gods, and for sheer exuberance could think of nothing
better to do than to indulge in the most frightful quarrels which,
especially when the windows were open, would collect numbers of alarmed
listeners in the square before the inn. (Length: 699 characters)

- Surely not the Italians, whom he
characterised simply as cochons; certainly not the French, who had only
imitated the Italians; nor the Germans, who would never get beyond
their childhood in music, and who, if they had ever possessed any
talent, had had it all spoilt for them by the Jews? ‘Oh, croyez-moi, il
y avait de l’espoir pour l’Allemagne lorsque j’etais empereur de la
musique a Berlin; mais depuis que le roi de Prusse a livre sa musique
au desordre occasionne par les deux juifs errants qu’il a attires, tout
espoir est perdu.’

Our charming hostess now thought it time to change the subject, and to
divert the master’s thoughts. (Length: 651 characters)
- My total ignorance of the English language stood
me in good stead here, and I was treated with unexpected consideration;
for, as none of the lower officials in that vast building could make
out what I wanted, I was sent, step by step, to one high dignitary
after the other, until at last I was introduced to a
distinguished-looking man, who came out of a large hall as we passed,
as an entirely unintelligible individual. (Minna was with me all the
time; only Robber. had been left behind at the King’s Arms.) He asked
me very civilly what I wanted, in French, and seemed favourably
impressed when I inquired for the celebrated author. (Length: 644 characters)
- To explain
his views about the fatal mistake of trying to succeed as a dramatic
composer ‘after Spontini,’ he began by praising me in these terms:
_‘Quand j’ai entendu votre Rienzi, j’ai dit, c’est un homme de génie,
mais déjà il a plus fait qu’il ne peut faire.’_ In order to show me
what he meant by this paradox, he proceeded as follows: _‘Après Gluck
c’est moi qui ai fait la grande révolution avec la_ Vestale; _j’ai
introduit le_ Vorhalt _de la sexte’_ (the suspension of the sixth)
_‘dans l’harmonie et la grosse caisse dans l’orchestre; avec_ Cortez
_j’ai fait un pas de plus en avant; puis j’ai fait trois pas avec_
Olympic. (Length: 643 characters)
- The winner in our case was a powerful grey-haired man, who, after much
vain battling with the seething waves, which tossed his light boat away
from our ship at each attempt, at last succeeded in boarding the
Thetis. (Our poor, hardly-used boat still bore the name, although the
wooden figure-head of our patron nymph had been hurled into the sea
during our first storm in the Cattegat—an ill-omened incident in the
eyes of the crew.) We were filled with pious gratitude when this quiet
English sailor, whose hands were torn and bleeding from his repeated
efforts to catch the rope thrown to him on his approach, took over the
rudder. (Length: 642 characters)
