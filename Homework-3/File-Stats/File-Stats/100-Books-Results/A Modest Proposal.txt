Top 10 Longest Sentences:
- And secondly,
There being a round million of creatures in humane figure throughout

leave them in debt two million of pounds sterling, adding those who are
beggars by profession, to the bulk of farmers, cottagers and labourers,
with their wives and children, who are beggars in effect; I desire
those politicians who dislike my overture, and may perhaps be so bold
to attempt an answer, that they will first ask the parents of these
mortals, whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness
to have been sold for food at a year old, in the manner I prescribe,
and thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes, as they
have since gone through, by the oppression of landlords, the
impossibility of paying rent without money or trade, the want of common
sustenance, with neither house nor clothes to cover them from the
inclemencies of the weather, and the most inevitable prospect of
intailing the like, or greater miseries, upon their breed for ever. (Length: 1059 characters)

own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and
instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of
pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein
of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country,
wherein we differ even from Laplanders, and the inhabitants of
Topinamboo: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any
longer like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the very moment
their city was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our
country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at
least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. (Length: 858 characters)

employ them in handicraft or agriculture; they neither build houses, (I
mean in the country) nor cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a

much earlier; during which time they can however be properly looked
upon only as probationers; as I have been informed by a principal

plentiful in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a
grave author, an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick
dyet, there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about
nine months after Lent, than at any other season; therefore, reckoning
a year after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because

and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening
the number of Papists among us. (Length: 602 characters)
